# luisd.model.instrument_definition_format.InstrumentDefinitionFormat

What is the provenance of an instrument. This defines who creates/owns it, what format it is in (e.g. a proprietary format or a common and known one)              and what the version of that is.

#### Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**sourceSystem** | **str** | which source system does the format originate from | 
**vendor** | **str** | An instrument will potentially have been created by any number of different organisations. Some will be understood completely (e.g. LUSID&#x27;s), some won&#x27;t.              The provenance of an instrument indicates who \&quot;owns\&quot; the associated format. | 
**version** | **str** | Version of the document. Would be preferable to avoid the need, but LUSID will not control other organisations&#x27; trade formats. |
