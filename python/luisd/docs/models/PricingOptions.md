**modelSelection** | [**ModelSelection**](ModelSelection.md) |  | [optional] 
**useInstrumentTypeToDeterminePricer** | **bool** | If true then use the instrument type to set the default instrument pricer  This applies where no more specific set of overrides are provided on a per-vendor and instrument basis. | [optional] 
**allowAnyInstrumentsWithSecUidToPriceOffLookup** | **bool** | By default, one would not expect to price and exotic instrument, i.e. an instrument with a complicated  instrument definition simply through looking up a price as there should be a better way of evaluating it.  To override that behaviour and allow lookup for a price from the instrument identifier(s), set this to true. | [optional] 
**allowPartiallySuccessfulEvaluation** | **bool** | If true then a failure in task evaluation doesn&#x27;t cause overall failure.  results will be returned where they succeeded and annotation elsewhere | [optional]
